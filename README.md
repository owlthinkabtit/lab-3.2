## Reflection Questions
1. How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
2. What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
3. How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?

I've had prior experience with using Figma designs in projects, so I felt right at home using them. I'm more of a visual person, so being give the visuals to recreate wasn't all too challenging, but I really enjoyed having a reference to point back to to make sure the finish product reflected that. 

Since I've had prior experiences, I knew what I was in for, I didn't really run into any challenges. My challenge that's more so of my own doing, is the fact that I was focused tooo much on perfection and making sure it loooked just like the figma to a T! The QR code turned out amazing, but I'm not too happy with the journal card project, that one didn't turn out exactly like it...but I think it's just my opinion on that.

I wasn't aware of the feedback on that site, since I only focused on getting the files from it. But anything with a community tied too it is a great resource. I'm sure it's helpful with learning new tips and tricks, and also just understanding the project a little more. Sometimes all it takes is getting a fresh pair of eyes on your work, since you're the one staring at it for hours on end.
